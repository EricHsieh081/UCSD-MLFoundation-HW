## Explanation
The source of the lectures are from edX UCSanDiegoX: "Machine Learing Fundamentals"
# Week1: Nearest Neighboring Classification
The first week includes several basic but enduring machine learning algorithms and different details and improvements.

# Week2&3: Generative Modeling
The goal is to figure out the theory of classification using gaussian distribution or other kinds of distribution to solve the problems of classification problems with multiple labels.

# Week6: Support Vector Machine
The goal is to examine which C is the best choice for the SVM to train and test data. Fold-Crossing Validation is used to solve the problem.
